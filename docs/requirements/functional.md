# RE: Functional Requirements

## [Priority] MVP

>These features NEED to be there, this is the minimal product we can possibly have without having a product. Forcing us into this model, forces us to avoid feature creep and prioritize tasks.

- Allow Customers to create accounts
- Allow Customers to browse coffee (unknowns exist)
- Allow Customers to purchase coffee
- Allow Customers to view past orders
- Allow Customers to store credit cards
- Allow Customers to rate coffee that they've purchased
- Allow Customers to comment about coffee that they've purchased
- Allow Vendors to create accounts 
- Allow Vendors to add a brand for their company (coffee co.)
- Allow Vendors to add products to their brand (coffee)
- Dispatch email notification to Vendor to ship product
- Dispatch email to Customer that product has been ordered
- Dispatch email to Customer that product has been shipped
- Handle payments between parties (unknowns exist)

## *Next in Line*

>Important, but not MVP. Our core product can still exist without this. They would be nice to have though...

- Allow customers to subscribe, having coffee delivered at a regular interval
- Allow Vendors to view ratings and respond to comments
   - should be relatively easy to implement
- Admin panel for viewing sales statistics (I know @EGartin <3's this)
   - we can implement the DB side of things in MVP, in interface wouldn't be MVP IMO

## *Back Burner*

>This is the stuff we would like to have, would certainly add value to the product, but either don't have a high priority, or would require a significant investment of time or money to accomplish.

- Allow Customers to purchase custom coffee (custom blends)
- Allow Customers to earn "points" on purchases (incentive program)
- Allow Vendors to view analytics of their product
- Allow Customers to order coffee "super fast" - deliver on scooters
