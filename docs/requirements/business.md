## RE: Business Requirements

>Allow customers to purchase coffee from our application.

Lets focus on prefabricated blends / roasts from reputable distributors for the time being.

>Allow customers to purchase coffee accessories from our application

Lets focus on just coffee for the time being / in MVP release 1.0.0.

>Allow coffee suppliers to sell their own product line from our application

Yes absolutely, this will need to be MVP I think.

>Analytics must be available for coffee suppliers and system owners

Megashalom important, but I'd argue that we can get by without this feature for a first release.
