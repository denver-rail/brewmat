# Grndz:Pages

## Home

#### Purpose

To give the user a overview about what our product is and how to use it.

#### Overview

Landing page, primary giving the user a sexy overview of the product with a quick and easy link to access the marketplace in many different forms and locations.

#### Other Notes

Devin has some bawlin' ideas for styling this. We can put the "competition" to shame.

## Marketplace

#### Purpose

To give the user a place to browse coffee.

#### Overview

This will be a major feature that provides the user with a sexy, fun and intuitive system for browsing coffee. From this page the user will be able to look at a product more specifically on it's respective page, however product pages are seperate from this page.

This page is a *virtual storefront*, ideally with targeted content for each specific user (!MVP), but will at its core, be a place with recent additions to the coffee selection, trending coffee, top sellers, etc.

#### Other Notes

Think of this page as the "Steam Storefront."

## Vendor

#### Purpose

Provide the user with a vendor specific page for viewing all products and vendor information.

#### Overview

This will give the user a page to reference for particular vendors (e.g. Pablos Coffee). There are two specific items of value for this page:

1. Vendor info (location, company info, etc.)
2. Listing of vendor's products

This is a GREAT place for vendors to list their products in a sexy, clean and intuitive format.

#### Other Notes

This can be a FUCKING SHALOM MONEY MAKER. 

Now all of a sudden, vendors (particularly small ones) don't have the overhead of creating an functioning online storefront for their products. 

We've built that for them, they just populate it with content and hit "save." Not only is this hugely appealing for vendors to use our product, it also could be a potential point for us to charge the vendors to use our site. 

For example, we could have a *free version*, which lets them add up to 3 products. A *medium version* and a *pro version*, which respectively allow for more and more coffee to be sold on the marketplace.
