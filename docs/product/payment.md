# Grndz MVP: Payment

1. Grndz takes direct payment for the coffee.
2. Grndz withholds funds from vendor until product is marked "shipped" w/ tracking #
   - Grndz retains our "fee"
   - the remaining cost of the coffee + shipping is transferred to the vendor

## POTENTIAL RISK(s): 

- item is shipped, but never arrives, we're left hanging with the bill
- producer never ships item, yet "mocks" the shipping info

## Mitigation:

- we have contracts with specific vendors (at least to start)
- we have invitation only for vendors (at least to start)
- we don't pay the vendor until the delivery service has indicated an item as delivered
